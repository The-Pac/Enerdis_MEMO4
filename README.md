# Enerdis_MEMO4
This is the upload of a school project realized by 4 students during 4 months. The creation of this project has for goal to allow :
- the access to the information on the electrical values.
- to visualize the cost/gain in euros of the system. 
- to archive the data in a local and remote database that centralizes all the production sites
- to contain the costs of the system by coupling a communicating energy meter (MODBUS RTU) validating the MID directive as: "MEMO4" with a Raspberry pi

The main objectives of the project :
- visualize in real time the electrical values measured by the module
- store the measurements retrieved in a local database
- send the data via LoRaWan to the remote database
- allow a technician to visualize the different sites and their values.
- allow the user to visualize his own electrical consumption
- create an autonomous system
- Do not require an internet connection
